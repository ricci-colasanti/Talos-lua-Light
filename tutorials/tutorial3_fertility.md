# Talos Tutorial 3: Adding Fertility

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add fertility to your demographic model. We'll build on the aging and mortality model from Tutorial 2, adding births to create a more complete population simulation. You'll learn how to create new individuals, assign their characteristics, and track population growth.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Add a fertility model to your simulation
- Create new individuals (births) with appropriate characteristics
- Understand how to work with household-level data
- Write complex Lua models that modify the population

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Tutorial 2 (or equivalent knowledge)
- The `population.csv` file from Tutorial 1
- A text editor

---

## Part 1: What We're Going to Build

So far we have:
- ✅ **Aging**: Everyone gets older each year
- ✅ **Mortality**: Some people die based on their age

Now we'll add:
- **Fertility**: Women of childbearing age can give birth

### What We Want to Do

**In plain English:** "Each year, for every woman aged 15-49 who is alive, there is a 5% chance she gives birth. If she gives birth, we add a new person to the population. The new baby inherits the mother's area, is randomly male or female, and is marked as alive."

### Why This Matters

Adding fertility completes the demographic cycle:
- **Births** add people to the population
- **Aging** moves people through the life course
- **Deaths** remove people from the population

With all three models, we can simulate realistic population dynamics.

## Part 2: Understanding Lua Table Operations

Before we write our fertility model, let's understand how to work with tables (lists) in Lua.

### Adding Items to a Table

In Lua, `table.insert()` adds a new item to the end of a list:

```lua
-- Create a list
local newborns = {}

-- Add a new person to the list
table.insert(newborns, {
  person_id = 11,
  age = 0,
  sex = "F",
  area = 1,
  alive = true
})
```

### Creating a New Person

A person is just a table with properties:

```lua
local baby = {
  person_id = 11,
  age = 0,
  sex = "F",
  area = 1,
  alive = true
}
```

### Finding the Maximum ID

To create new unique IDs, we need to find the highest existing ID:

```lua
local max_id = 0
for _, person in ipairs(population) do
  if person.person_id > max_id then
    max_id = person.person_id
  end
end
```

Then the next ID is `max_id + 1`.

---

## Part 3: The Fertility Model in Lua

### The Complete Fertility Model

Here's the Lua script for our fertility model:

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  -- Get fertility rate from parameters
  local fertility_rate = params.fertility_rate or 0.05
  
  -- Create a list for newborns
  local newborns = {}
  
  -- Find the maximum ID
  local max_id = 0
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.person_id ~= nil and person.person_id > max_id then
      max_id = person.person_id
    end
  end
  
  -- Process each person
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    -- Check if this person is a fertile woman
    if person.alive == true and person.sex == "F" then
      local age = person.age
      if age >= 15 and age < 50 then
        -- Roll the dice for fertility
        if math.random() < fertility_rate then
          -- Create a newborn
          max_id = max_id + 1
          local baby = {
            person_id = max_id,
            age = 0,
            sex = math.random() < 0.5 and "F" or "M",
            area = person.area,
            alive = true
          }
          table.insert(newborns, baby)
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  -- Add newborns to population
  for _, baby in ipairs(newborns) do
    table.insert(population, baby)
  end
  
  return population
end
```

### Breaking It Down Piece by Piece

**First, in plain English:** "Go through every woman who is alive and aged 15-49. For each one, flip a coin. If it comes up heads (5% chance), create a new baby. The baby gets a new ID, age 0, a random sex (50:50), and lives in the same area as the mother. The baby is alive."

**Now let's break down each part:**

| Part | What it does | In plain English |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| `local fertility_rate = params.fertility_rate or 0.05` | Get rate | "Use the rate from the config, or 5% if not specified" |
| `local newborns = {}` | Create list | "Create an empty list for babies born this year" |
| `for _, person in ipairs(population) do` | Loop through people | "For each person in the population..." |
| `if person.alive == true and person.sex == "F" then` | Check woman | "...if they are a woman and alive..." |
| `if age >= 15 and age < 50 then` | Check age | "...and they're of childbearing age (15-49)..." |
| `if math.random() < fertility_rate then` | Roll dice | "...roll a random number..." |
| `max_id = max_id + 1` | New ID | "...if it's less than the fertility rate, create a new ID" |
| `local baby = { ... }` | Create baby | "...create a new baby with properties" |
| `table.insert(newborns, baby)` | Add to list | "...add the baby to the list of newborns" |
| `table.insert(population, baby)` | Add to population | "...add the baby to the population" |

### Understanding the New ID Generation

```lua
-- Find the maximum ID
local max_id = 0
for _, person in ipairs(population) do
  if person.person_id ~= nil and person.person_id > max_id then
    max_id = person.person_id
  end
end

-- Then later, when creating a baby:
max_id = max_id + 1
local baby = {
  person_id = max_id,
  ...
}
```

**Why do we need this?** We need unique IDs for each new person. If the highest ID is 10, the next should be 11, then 12, etc.

### Understanding Random Sex Assignment

```lua
sex = math.random() < 0.5 and "F" or "M"
```

**In plain English:** "Flip a coin. If it's heads (50% chance), the baby is female. Otherwise, the baby is male."

This is a Lua shorthand for:

```lua
if math.random() < 0.5 then
  sex = "F"
else
  sex = "M"
end
```

## Part 6: Why Model Order Matters

The order of models is crucial. Here's why we run them in this specific order:

### Priority 1: Aging First

```yaml
priority: 1  # Runs first
```

**Why?** Women need to be the correct age for fertility. A woman who is 14 should not give birth, but if she turns 15 this year, she should be eligible.

### Priority 2: Mortality Second

```yaml
priority: 2  # Runs second
```

**Why?** Dead women shouldn't give birth. We need to remove people who die before checking fertility.

### Priority 3: Fertility Last

```yaml
priority: 3  # Runs last
```

**Why?** Newborns shouldn't be aged or killed in the same year they're born.

### Visualizing the Order

```
Start of Year
    ↓
1. AGE everyone (including women who turn 15)
    ↓
2. MORTALITY (dead people don't give birth)
    ↓
3. FERTILITY (women give birth to babies who are age 0)
    ↓
End of Year
```

## Part 7: Examining the Output CSV

After running the simulation, open `population_complete.csv`:

```csv
person_id,age,sex,area,alive
1,35,F,1,true
2,40,M,1,true
3,55,F,1,true
4,78,M,1,true
5,92,F,1,true
6,12,M,1,true
7,25,F,1,true
8,45,M,1,true
9,65,F,1,true
10,80,M,1,false
11,5,M,1,true
12,3,F,1,true
13,0,F,1,true
14,0,M,1,true
```

**Notice:**
- Person 10 is now dead (`alive = false`)
- Person 11-14 are new (they weren't in the original population)
- Persons 13 and 14 are age 0 (newborns from the final year)

---

## Part 8: Advanced Fertility - Age-Specific Rates

### The Problem

In our current model, all women 15-49 have the same 5% chance of giving birth. But in reality, fertility varies by age.

### What We Want to Do

**In plain English:** "Women in their 20s have the highest fertility, women in their 40s have much lower fertility."

### The Updated Lua Script

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  local newborns = {}
  
  local max_id = 0
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.person_id ~= nil and person.person_id > max_id then
      max_id = person.person_id
    end
  end
  
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.sex == "F" then
      local age = person.age
      local rate = 0
      
      -- Age-specific fertility rates
      if age >= 15 and age < 20 then
        rate = 0.02   -- 2% chance
      elseif age >= 20 and age < 25 then
        rate = 0.08   -- 8% chance
      elseif age >= 25 and age < 30 then
        rate = 0.10   -- 10% chance (peak fertility)
      elseif age >= 30 and age < 35 then
        rate = 0.08   -- 8% chance
      elseif age >= 35 and age < 40 then
        rate = 0.04   -- 4% chance
      elseif age >= 40 and age < 45 then
        rate = 0.01   -- 1% chance
      elseif age >= 45 and age < 50 then
        rate = 0.001  -- 0.1% chance
      end
      
      if math.random() < rate then
        max_id = max_id + 1
        local baby = {
          person_id = max_id,
          age = 0,
          sex = math.random() < 0.5 and "F" or "M",
          area = person.area,
          alive = true
        }
        table.insert(newborns, baby)
      end
    end
  end
  
  for _, baby in ipairs(newborns) do
    table.insert(population, baby)
  end
  
  return population
end
```

### Understanding the Rates

| Age Group | Rate | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| 15-19 | 2% | Low - teenage pregnancies |
| 20-24 | 8% | Higher - peak childbearing years start |
| 25-29 | 10% | Peak fertility |
| 30-34 | 8% | Still high but declining |
| 35-39 | 4% | Declining |
| 40-44 | 1% | Low |
| 45-49 | 0.1% | Very low |

---

## Part 9: Advanced Fertility - Copying Mother's Characteristics

### The Problem

In our current model, babies only inherit the mother's area. But in reality, babies inherit many characteristics from their parents.

### What We Want to Do

**In plain English:** "When a baby is born, copy the mother's ethnicity, education, and other characteristics to the baby."

### The Updated CSV with Mother's Characteristics

First, let's create a population file with the additional columns needed. Create a file called `population_with_ethnicity.csv`:

```csv
person_id,age,sex,area,alive,ethnicity,education,income
1,25,F,1,true,White,tertiary,45000
2,30,M,1,true,White,secondary,35000
3,45,F,1,true,Asian,tertiary,52000
4,68,M,1,true,Black,secondary,28000
5,82,F,1,true,White,primary,15000
6,2,M,1,true,Asian,primary,0
7,15,F,1,true,White,secondary,0
8,35,M,1,true,Black,tertiary,48000
9,55,F,1,true,Asian,secondary,32000
10,70,M,1,true,White,primary,18000
11,5,F,1,true,Asian,primary,0
12,40,M,1,true,Black,tertiary,55000
13,60,F,1,true,White,secondary,30000
14,75,M,1,true,Asian,primary,12000
15,20,F,1,true,White,secondary,25000
```

**Columns explained:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `person_id` | Unique identifier for each individual |
| `age` | Age in years |
| `sex` | Gender (M/F) |
| `area` | Geographic area (1-5) |
| `alive` | Whether the person is alive (true/false) |
| `ethnicity` | Ethnic group (White, Asian, Black, etc.) |
| `education` | Highest education level (primary, secondary, tertiary) |
| `income` | Annual income |

### The Updated Lua Script

Now, update the fertility script to copy these characteristics from the mother:

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  local fertility_rate = params.fertility_rate or 0.05
  local newborns = {}
  
  local max_id = 0
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.person_id ~= nil and person.person_id > max_id then
      max_id = person.person_id
    end
  end
  
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.sex == "F" then
      local age = person.age
      if age >= 15 and age < 50 then
        if math.random() < fertility_rate then
          max_id = max_id + 1
          local baby = {
            person_id = max_id,
            age = 0,
            sex = math.random() < 0.5 and "F" or "M",
            area = person.area,
            alive = true,
            -- Copy mother's characteristics
            ethnicity = person.ethnicity,
            education = "none",  -- Babies have no education yet
            income = 0           -- Babies have no income
          }
          table.insert(newborns, baby)
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  for _, baby in ipairs(newborns) do
    table.insert(population, baby)
  end
  
  return population
end
```

### What's Changed

We added three new fields to the baby table:
- `ethnicity = person.ethnicity` - Copy mother's ethnicity
- `education = "none"` - Set a default for babies
- `income = 0` - Set a default for babies

Now babies inherit their mother's ethnicity!

### Examining the Output CSV

After running the simulation, open `population_ethnicity_output.csv`:

```csv
person_id,age,sex,area,alive,ethnicity,education,income
1,35,F,1,true,White,tertiary,45000
2,40,M,1,true,White,secondary,35000
3,55,F,1,true,Asian,tertiary,52000

6,12,M,1,true,Asian,primary,0
7,25,F,1,true,White,secondary,0
8,45,M,1,true,Black,tertiary,48000
9,65,F,1,true,Asian,secondary,32000

```

**Notice:**
- Person 16 is a newborn male with `ethnicity = White` (inherited from mother)
- Person 17 is a newborn female with `ethnicity = Asian` (inherited from mother)
- Both have `education = "none"` and `income = 0`

## Part 10: Advanced Fertility - Tracking Mother-Child Relationships

### The Problem

We want to track which mother had which child.

### What We Want to Do

**In plain English:** "When a baby is born, record the mother's ID. This allows us to track family relationships."

### The Updated CSV with Mother-Child Tracking

Create a file called `population_with_family.csv`:

```csv
person_id,age,sex,area,alive,partner_id,mother_id,father_id,parity,ethnicity,education,income
1,25,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,White,tertiary,45000
2,30,M,1,true,1,0,0,0,White,secondary,35000
3,45,F,1,true,0,0,0,2,Asian,tertiary,52000
4,68,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,Black,secondary,28000
5,82,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,White,primary,15000
6,2,M,1,true,0,3,0,0,Asian,primary,0
7,15,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,White,secondary,0
8,35,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,Black,tertiary,48000
9,55,F,1,true,0,0,0,3,Asian,secondary,32000
10,70,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,White,primary,18000
11,5,F,1,true,0,9,0,0,Asian,primary,0
12,40,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,Black,tertiary,55000
13,60,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,White,secondary,30000
14,75,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,Asian,primary,12000
15,20,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,White,secondary,25000
```

**New columns explained:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `partner_id` | ID of partner/spouse (0 if none) |
| `mother_id` | ID of mother (0 if unknown) |
| `father_id` | ID of father (0 if unknown) |
| `parity` | Number of children a woman has had |

### The Updated Lua Script

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  local fertility_rate = params.fertility_rate or 0.05
  local newborns = {}
  local mothers_to_update = {}
  
  local max_id = 0
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.person_id ~= nil and person.person_id > max_id then
      max_id = person.person_id
    end
  end
  
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.sex == "F" then
      local age = person.age
      if age >= 15 and age < 50 then
        if math.random() < fertility_rate then
          max_id = max_id + 1
          local baby = {
            person_id = max_id,
            age = 0,
            sex = math.random() < 0.5 and "F" or "M",
            area = person.area,
            alive = true,
            mother_id = person.person_id,  -- Track the mother
            father_id = person.partner_id or 0,  -- Track the father (if known)
            parity = 0,                    -- First child
            ethnicity = person.ethnicity,
            education = "none",
            income = 0
          }
          table.insert(newborns, baby)
          
          -- Track that this mother needs parity update
          mothers_to_update[person.person_id] = true
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  -- Add newborns to population
  for _, baby in ipairs(newborns) do
    table.insert(population, baby)
  end
  
  -- Update mother parity (number of children)
  for mother_id in pairs(mothers_to_update) do
    for _, person in ipairs(population) do
      if person.person_id == mother_id then
        person.parity = (person.parity or 0) + 1
        break
      end
    end
  end
  
  return population
end
```

### What's Changed

We added:
1. **`mother_id = person.person_id`** - Track which mother had the baby
2. **`father_id = person.partner_id or 0`** - Track the father if the mother has a partner
3. **`parity = 0`** - Each baby starts with parity 0 (their own children count)
4. **`mothers_to_update`** - Track which mothers need their parity updated
5. **Second pass** - Update each mother's parity

### Understanding Parity

**Parity** is the number of children a woman has had.

- A woman who has had 2 children has parity 2
- A woman who has had 0 children has parity 0

When a woman gives birth, her parity increases by 1.

## Part 11: Complete Configuration with Advanced Fertility

Here's the full configuration with advanced fertility features:

### The Advanced Population CSV

First, let's create a population file with the additional columns needed for the advanced fertility model. Create a file called `population_advanced.csv`:

```csv

1,25,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,White,tertiary,45000
2,30,M,1,true,0,1,0,0,0,White,secondary,35000
3,45,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,2,Asian,tertiary,52000
4,68,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,Black,secondary,28000
5,82,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,White,primary,15000
6,2,M,1,true,0,0,0,3,0,Asian,primary,0
7,15,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,White,secondary,0
8,35,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,Black,tertiary,48000
9,55,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,3,Asian,secondary,32000
10,70,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,White,primary,18000
11,5,F,1,true,0,0,0,9,0,Asian,primary,0
12,40,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,Black,tertiary,55000
13,60,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,White,secondary,30000
14,75,M,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,Asian,primary,12000
15,20,F,1,true,0,0,0,0,0,White,secondary,25000
```

Notice that:
- Person 15 (age 20 in the original) is now 30 after 10 iterations
- Person 16 is a newborn (age 0) with `mother_id = 15`, inheriting the mother's area, ethnicity, and other characteristics
- Mothers' parity has been updated as they had children

## Part 12: What You've Accomplished

Congratulations! You now have a complete demographic microsimulation model with:

1. ✅ **Aging**: Everyone gets older each year
2. ✅ **Mortality**: Age-specific death probabilities
3. ✅ **Fertility**: Women of childbearing age can give birth
4. ✅ **Age-Specific Fertility**: Different rates for different age groups
5. ✅ **Mother-Child Links**: Track which mother had which child
6. ✅ **Parity Tracking**: Track how many children each woman has
7. ✅ **Population Growth**: Births and deaths change population size

## Part 13: What You Can Do Next

### 1. Add Education Models

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.age >= 5 and person.age <= 18 then
      -- Progress through education
      if person.education == "none" then
        person.education = "primary"
      elseif person.education == "primary" and person.age >= 11 then
        person.education = "secondary"
      elseif person.education == "secondary" and person.age >= 16 then
        -- Could go to tertiary or leave
      end
    end
  end
  return population
end
```

### 2. Add Income Models

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.age >= 18 then
      -- Income depends on age, education, and sex
      local base = 20000
      local education_bonus = 0
      if person.education == "tertiary" then
        education_bonus = 15000
      elseif person.education == "secondary" then
        education_bonus = 5000
      end
      local age_factor = math.min(1, (person.age - 18) / 20)  -- Peaks around 38
      local sex_factor = 0.8
      if person.sex == "M" then
        sex_factor = 1.0
      end
      person.income = (base + education_bonus) * age_factor * sex_factor
    end
  end
  return population
end
```

### 3. Add Household Formation

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  -- Add household_id column
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.household_id == nil then
      person.household_id = person.person_id  -- Each person starts as their own household
    end
  end
  
  -- Young adults form households
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.age >= 18 and person.age <= 25 then
      if math.random() < 0.05 then  -- 5% chance per year
        person.household_id = person.person_id  -- New household
      end
    end
  end
  
  -- Children live with mothers
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true and person.age < 18 and person.mother_id ~= nil then
      -- Find mother
      for _, mother in ipairs(population) do
        if mother.person_id == person.mother_id and mother.alive == true then
          person.household_id = mother.household_id
          break
        end
      end
    end
  end
  
  return population
end
```

### 4. Add Migration

```lua
function transition(population, params)
  local migration_rate = params.migration_rate or 0.05
  local num_areas = params.num_areas or 5
  
  for _, person in ipairs(population) do
    if person.alive == true then
      -- Migration probability by age
      local age = person.age
      local rate = 0
      if age < 18 then
        rate = migration_rate * 0.4
      elseif age >= 18 and age < 35 then
        rate = migration_rate * 1.5
      elseif age >= 35 and age < 65 then
        rate = migration_rate * 0.6
      else
        rate = migration_rate * 0.2
      end
      
      if math.random() < rate then
        person.previous_area = person.area
        person.area = math.random(1, num_areas)
      end
    end
  end
  
  return population
end
```

## Summary of Lua Concepts Learned

| Concept | What it does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `table.insert()` | Add to list | `table.insert(list, item)` |
| `math.random()` | Random number | `math.random()` or `math.random(1, 10)` |
| `and` / `or` | Logical operators | `if person.alive and person.sex == "F"` |
| `{}` | Create table | `{ name = "John", age = 25 }` |
| `for` loop | Iterate | `for _, person in ipairs(population) do` |
| `if-elseif-else` | Conditions | `if age < 18 then ... end` |
